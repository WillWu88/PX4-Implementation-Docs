# Experiment: Determining the Moment of Inertia

## 1. Motivation, Background
The goal of this experiment is to empirically determine the moment of inertia of our experimental aircraft. Specifically, there are three moments of inertia associated: $I_{xx}$, $I_{yy}$ and $I_{zz}$ 

Aircraft Moment of Inertia (physical pendulum) 
$$I = \frac{T^2ml}{4\pi^2} - \frac{ml^2}{g}$$
Aircraft Moment of Inertia (torsion pendulum)
$$I = \frac{md^2T^2}{16\pi^2l}$$
- $T$ is the oscillation period
- $l$ is the length of the string
- $d$ is the distance between strings of the bifilar pendulum

We are ignoring the string moment of inertia, assuming the strings have negligible weight

Questions:
- where is the $g$ term?
	- run the same experiment on parrot mini drone and compare results
